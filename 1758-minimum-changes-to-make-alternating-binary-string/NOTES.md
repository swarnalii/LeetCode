Small observation that the sequence of index is [0,1,2,3..],
if we get its module by 2, we get [0,1,0,1,0..],
which is the alternating binary sequence we want.
​
So we iterate the string,
check if the characters[i] is same as the i % 2.
Note that s[i] is a character,
and s[i] - '0' making it to integer.
​
We accumulate the number of difference,
which is the number of operation to make it into 01 string.
​
We can do the same to find out res,
the number of operation for 10 string.
But we don't have to,
becaue this equals to s.length - res
