Distance traveled by slow when they meet: L1+L2
Distance traveled by fast when they meet: L1+L2+x+L2, where x is the remaining length of the cycle (meeting point to start of the cycle).
​
2(L1+L2) = L1+L2+x+L2
2L1 + 2L2 = L1+2L2+x
=> x = L1
​
so we need to move L1 steps from the current meeting point to reach the entry point of the cycle.
